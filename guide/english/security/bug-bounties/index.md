## Bug Bounties

Bug bounties are programs that are set up by companies to encourage people to check their products for vulnerabilities.  In return these companies offer cash prizes for the discovered vulnerabilities.

### Benefits to bounty hunters

The benefits to the bounty hunters are fairly straightforward.  They get paid for what they find and get to improve their skills

### Benefits to companies

The companies that sponsor these programs gain several benefits:

- Many eyes on their product are more likely to find more bugs than the typical QA team
- Only have to pay for results, not for the time spent trying to find bugs
- Encourages people who find vulnerabilties to turn them over to the company and not to the black market.
